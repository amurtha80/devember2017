Devember 2017! An attempt to bolster my coding skills and maybe become a creator


I, Andy Murtha, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be to learn python programming and attempt to create some small projects I can use in my professional career, as well as personal life. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.
